    r"""
    Compare the contents of two text files.  The comparison uses the Unix
    'diff' command.  Differences can be selectively ignored by use of
    the skip_string parameter.  The output of diff command is written
    to a user-specified file and is also written (logged) to the console.

    Description of arguments:
    file1_path       File containing text data.
    file2_path       Text file to compare to file1.
    diff_file_path   Text file which will contain the diff output.
    skip_string      To allow for differences which may expected or immaterial,
                     skip_string parameter is a word or a string of comma
                     separated words which specify what should be ignored.
                     For example, "size,speed".  Any line containing the word
                     size or the word speed will be ignored when the diff is
                     performed.  This parameter is optional.

    Returns:
    0 if both files contain the same information or they differ only in
      items specified by the skip_string.
    2 if FILES_DO_NOT_MATCH.
    3 if INPUT_FILE_DOES_NOT_EXIST.
    4 if IO_EXCEPTION_READING_FILE.
    5 if IO_EXCEPTION_WRITING_FILE.
